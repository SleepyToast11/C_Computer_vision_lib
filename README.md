A library of a few computer vision algorithms. Currently the project is seperated in a few parts, with plans to merge all them in a single program using command line arguments.

The first 2 are mostly just filters and component analysis based on a simple min pixel value and outputs in a folder.

Last 2 parts are repectively a kmeans and mean-shift. Like the rest of the project it runs on a single thread, as at the time of writing the code, concurrency in c was not mastered. Plans to add concurrency is in the todo.

A bit of work is needed, since it was my first project written in the language and the course it was written for was masters level and I was undergrad at the time. The whole project is written in pure C. Overall, learned alot with it and can't wait to get back to it and clean the code as soon as I get the time.

Feel free to send me an email if there's anything. 
Also, please consider this as being public domain, I'll be happy if my previous suffering can help anyone.
Finally, I'm sorry for how some parts of it look, the first step to become old and wise is to be young and stupid and this is an example of the latter :)
